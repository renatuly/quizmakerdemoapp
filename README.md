QuizMaker is a web application for both creating and taking quizzes. You can create quizzes and manage them with three types of questions (for now): single-answer questions, multiple-choice questions, and text answer questions.  At the beginning, I wanted to create something related to user registration. Still, due to the lack of knowledge in the field of backend,  I decided to make the task simpler way, but encountered lots of difficulties during the coding process, and managed to come to this point. Since it is always about the process, not the result, I am truly happy to share this mini-project. To use this website, it is enough to just click the Vercel app link or the GitHub.io link, which will be provided on the Typeform. Even though other stacks would be much easier for usage, I chose to use HTML, CSS, and sole JS was made for both simplicity and flexibility.
